                    Welcome to Sub Mart, your number one source for all things fresh and organic.
                     We're dedicated to giving you the very best of locally sourced produce, with a
                      focus on quality, customer service, and uniqueness. Founded in 2020 by Maria Gomez,
                       Sub Mart has come a long way from its beginnings in a small garage. When Maria
                        first started out, her passion for providing the best organic produce drove her
                         to quit her day job, and gave her the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration 
                         into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the country and are
                          thrilled to be a part of the fair trade wing of the grocery industry.
